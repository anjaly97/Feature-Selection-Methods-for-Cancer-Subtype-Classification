# Feature-Selection-Methods-for-Cancer-Subtype-Classification
 Comparison study of different Feature selection methods for Cancer Subtype classification
** ##Introduction**
 Differential diagnosis of Cancer sub-types and thus their treatments are one of the most
challenging problems in clinical Medicine.. To choose the right treatment plan, a proper
diagnosis is to be made.This project is intended to accurately classify a patientâ€™s cancer type
based on gene expressions.
We have modelled a SVM classifier using different feature selection methods (Variance
threshold,Selectkbest,selectmodel,RFE and SFS) to find the top features that would help in the
accurate prediction of Cancer subclasses.The refined data set with quality samples makes it
easier for differential diagnosis
